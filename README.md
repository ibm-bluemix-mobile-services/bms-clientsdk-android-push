This is the push component of Android SDK for IBM Bluemix Mobile Services. https://console.ng.bluemix.net/solutions/mobilefirst

###Installation
You can either download and import this package to your Android Studio project or get it via Gradle.

###Contents
This package contains the push components of Android SDK.  This package has to be used in combination with core SDK.

###Supported Levels
The package is supported on Android API level 14 and up (Android 4.0 and up).

###Sound Configuration
1. Create a folder named `raw` in the `res` directory of your android application and add the ringtone files to that folder.
2. Specify the ringtone file name when you send notification from Bluemix Push dashboard.

####3.2
* Added support to listen to the notification status by registering the MFPPushNotificationStatusListener with MFPPush as shown below
````
 push.setNotificationStatusListener(new MFPPushNotificationStatusListener() {
	@Override
		public void onStatusChange(String messageId, MFPPushNotificationStatus status) {
		// Handle status change
		}
	});
````
Add the below snippet in AndroidManifest.xml to capture the notification dismissal status.

````
	<receiver android:name="com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.push.api.MFPPushNotificationDismissHandler">
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="Your_Android_Package_Name.Cancel_IBMPushNotification"/>
		</intent-filter>
	</receiver>
````

####3.1
* Bug fix: Fix support for interactive push notification.  Interactive notifications can be used by using the below code.

````
 MFPPushNotificationOptions options = new MFPPushNotificationOptions();
        MFPPushNotificationButton firstButton = new MFPPushNotificationButton.Builder("Accept Button")
                .setIcon("check_circle")
                .setLabel("Accept")
                .setPerformsInForeground(true)
                .build();

        MFPPushNotificationButton secondButton = new MFPPushNotificationButton.Builder("Decline Button")
                .setIcon("extension")
                .setLabel("Decline")
                .setPerformsInForeground(true)
                .build();

        options.setInteractiveNotificationButtonGroup("First_Button_Group", firstButton, secondButton);
        MFPPush.getInstance().setNotificationOptions(options);
 ````

####3.0 

* Update push service to use FCM instead of GCM. All existing applications will work as-is and moving forward all new applications will use FCM.  The client application set up is different in FCM in comparison to the old GCM model. Please refer to [documentation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/mobilepush/c_android_enable.html) for details.
* To compile the SDK, create a FCM project in google console -> Add firebase to android application -> Add the package names `com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.app` , `com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.push` and `com.ibm.mobilefirst.clientsdk.android.app` -> Copy the generated google-services.json file inside the `app` directory.


####2.0.9
* Support to specify multiple custom icons for notification.
* Enhanced error checking and bug fixes.

####2.0.8
* Included support to retrieve individual notifications from the notification tray. If the notification is tapped on from the notification tray, the developer is provided with a handle only to the notification that is being clicked.  When the application is openend normally, then all the notifications are displayed.

Include the below in your AndroidManifest.xml to use this functionality

```
<activity android:name="com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.push.api.MFPPushNotificationHandler"
          android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoDisplay"/>
```

####2.0.7
* Fixed bugs.

####2.0.6
* Updated SDK to include custom android notification options - expandable notifications, priority, visibility, sync notifications across devices, timeToLive etc
* Set default options for these parameters on the SDK, that can be overridden from the server during send notification call.

####2.0.5
* Updated the userId based API.

####2.0.4
* Updated with userId based notifications support.
* To register UserId based notifications follow the below steps,

```
    1. MFPPush push = MFPPush.getInstance();
    2. push.initialize(getApplicationContext(),"your appGuid of push", "clientSecret");
    3. registerDeviceWithUserId("your userId"",new MFPPushResponseListener<String>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(String deviceId) {
                updateTextView("Device is registered with Push Service.");
                displayTags();
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(MFPPushException ex) {
                updateTextView("Error registering with Push Service...\n" + ex.toString()
                + "Push notifications will not be received.");
            }
        });
```
